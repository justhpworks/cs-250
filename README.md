1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To interpret user needs and implement them into a program, I start by gathering detailed requirements through direct interactions with stakeholders and analyzing their feedback. User stories were then created by breaking down the given requirements into manageable, actionable tasks that reflect the end users' needs and can be updated or adjusted when needed. User stories provide a clear and structured way to document features from the user's perspective, ensuring that development aligns closely with their expectations. Test cases are then developed based on these user stories to ensure that each feature is thoroughly tested and meets the specified requirements, ensuring that the implementation aligns with user needs and expectations.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to developing programs involves iterative development and continuous feedback, ie. using a Scrum-Agile approach. I plan to incorporate Agile processes such as Scrum into my future developmental work as I enjoyed the process of both learning about and using it within this class. As someone who prefers to take projects and break them down into more 'bite sized' pieces, it definitely helped turn a large, multi-stepped project into something that did not feel overwhelming as it was spread out week by week, allowing for it to be chipped away at slowly rather than having to do everything all at once.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member in software development means to contribute actively to the team’s goals, communicate clearly and openly in a healthy, constructive manner and be flexible to any and all foreseeable changes. It involves supporting teammates, sharing knowledge, and collaborating effectively to solve problems. A positive attitude and a commitment to delivering high-quality work while respecting others' perspectives are essential traits for successful teamwork.
